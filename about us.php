                           previous owner has abandoned or released to a shelter or rescue  <br />
                           organization. Common sources for adoptable pets are animal shelters <br />
                           and rescue groups. Some organizations give adopters ownership of the <br />
                           pet, while others use a guardianship model wherein the organization <br />
                           retains some control over the animal's future use or care.       </b></p>
